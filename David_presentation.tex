\section{Introduction}

The main objective of HSC Project is to understand the correlation between the star formation history and Dark Matter Halos of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) through studying the slope of the luminosity density profiles.

In order to certify the validity of our results, it is essential that we test the photometric contamination caused by fainter galaxies that are not properly resolved, or \textit{deblended}. Such galaxies can saturate the apparent magnitude of the galaxy, most prominently at greater aperture distances from the center.
